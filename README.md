## 📂 Repository

### 🚀 Git Flow
We follow the Gitflow workflow. Each new feature is developed in a separate branch. Once the feature is complete, it is merged into the `dev` branch through a pull request (PR). Once a stable version is ready on `dev` branch, it can be merged directly into the `main` branch through a PR. Wich is the production branch.

### 🌿 Branches
- Use snake_case for branch names.
- Branchs should be associated as often as possible to an issue. 1 issue for 1 branch and 1 branch for 1 issue.
- Link a branch to an issue by setting the issue id as a prefix
    - Example: `123/add_login_functionality`, `12/bug_in_authentication`

### 📝 Commits
- Explain the changes clearly and concisely.
- Use lowercase for commit messages.

### 🐛 Issues
The project is driven by issues

Issue should be labeled the following pattern (optionnal) : topic - (layer) - (package) :
- Topic :
  - feature
  - bug
  - build
  - documentation
  - refactor
  - repo
- layer :
  - core
  - module
- package :
  - front
  - behavior
  - manager
  - render
  - sounds
  - util
  
Issues should be resolved following MoSCoW order indicated by the milestones :
- Must
- Sould
- Could
- Won't

Issues should be closed with PR :
- Associate a PR with an issue __manually__ or by declaring `[keyword] #[issue_id]` in the PR __description__
- Keywords :
  - close
  - closes
  - closed
  - fix
  - fixes
  - fixed
  - resolve
  - resolves
  - resolved
- Example : `resolved #12`
