## 📂 Repository

### 🚀 Git Flow
We follow the Gitflow workflow. Each new feature is developed in a separate branch. Once the feature is complete, it is merged into the `dev` branch through a pull request (PR). The feature is tested in the `dev` branch, and once it is deemed perfect, it is merged directly into the `main` branch through a PR.

### 🌿 Branches
- Use snake_case for branch names.
- Prefix branches with `feature/`, `fix/`, etc.
  - Example: `feature/add_login_functionality`, `fix/bug_in_authentication`

### 📝 Commits
- Always try to link commits to an issue.
- Explain the changes clearly and concisely.
- Use lowercase for commit messages.
  - Example: `fix: resolve issue #123 by correcting authentication bug`
